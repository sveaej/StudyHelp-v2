UPDATE: This project is paused because my system is having issues with compiling C++ (it cannot find the headers). I have been working
on this issue for a while now and have not fixed it yet. Thank you for viewing this project regardless! Most of its functionality
remains unimplemented, but I am excited to get back to it once I fix my system issues.

This project is a rewrite of an old study tool I made back when I was taking Spanish.
The main purpose of this project is to refresh my knowledge of C++ and object-oriented programming in general, since I haven't
used it in a while. It's pretty simple, using files instead of a database and the command line instead of a UI. I may expand upon
it or build another version of it in the future.
